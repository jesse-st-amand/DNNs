# Placeholder for tests for the Dense layer.
# You will write unit tests here to verify:
# - Correct output dimensions for the forward pass.
# - Correct gradient calculations for the backward pass (if doing manual backprop).
# - Proper weight initialization.
# - Behavior with different inputs and configurations.
