# Placeholder for an example script to run a simple MLP.
# Here you would:
# 1. Import your MLP model and any necessary layers from dnn_lib.
# 2. Prepare some sample data (e.g., XOR problem data).
# 3. Instantiate your MLP model.
# 4. (Once implemented) Instantiate an optimizer and a loss function.
# 5. (Once implemented) Train the model on the data.
# 6. (Once implemented) Evaluate the model or make predictions.
